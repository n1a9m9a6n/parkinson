# Detecting Parkinson disease

In this Python Machine learning project, I built a ml model using which we can accurately detect the presence of Parkinson’s disease in one’s body.
Algorithm used: XGBoost, XGBoost stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting and is based on decision trees. In this project, the XGBClassifier from the xgboost library is imported; this is an implementation of the scikit-learn API for XGBoost classification.
